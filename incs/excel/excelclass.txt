This PHP4 class uses the COM extension of PHP to access some of the functionalities of Excel 2000.
The class has been tested with PHP4.02 running as cgi with Apache 1.3.9 on win98.
It should work with Excel 97 but it has not been tested.
It is very much a "work in progress". Though the main functionalities of Excel are supported 
(Opening/Closing workbooks, writing and reading a cell and range of cells, running functions
and macros), a lot of other Excel features has yet to be supported, notably the Excel charts
I will try to complete this class later, but other users are welcome to do it themselves. 
Also please report any bugs or problems to me (alain@samoun.com) so I can correct it if 
possible.
